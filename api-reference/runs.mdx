Runs represent the execution of an approved intent on a sprite. They track the progress and output of skill execution.

## List Runs

```bash
GET /api/runs
```

Returns all runs, optionally filtered.

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `intent_id` | Filter by parent intent |
| `sprite_name` | Filter by sprite |
| `status` | Filter by status (`running`, `completed`, `failed`, `blocked`) |

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "run_xyz789",
      "intent_id": "intent_abc123",
      "sprite_name": "atlas",
      "status": "completed",
      "started_at": "2026-02-17T12:00:00Z",
      "completed_at": "2026-02-17T12:01:30Z"
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2026-02-17T12:02:00Z"
}
```

## Get Run Detail

```bash
GET /api/runs/:id
```

Returns full detail for a run including output, events, and timing.

## Answer Blocked Run

```bash
POST /api/runs/:id/answer
```

Provides an answer to a run that is blocked waiting for human input (e.g., a `question` event from the sprite).

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "answer": "Yes, proceed with the migration"
}
```

The run resumes execution after receiving the answer.
