import { Card, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Lattice is an **Elixir/Phoenix control plane for managing AI coding agents ("Sprites")**. It provides a real-time operations dashboard, safety guardrails, and human-in-the-loop approval workflows -- the way a NOC engineer manages a fleet of servers.

## What Lattice Does

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Fleet Operations" icon="rocket">
    Real-time LiveView dashboard for monitoring and managing your entire fleet of
    Sprites. See what every agent is doing at a glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Safety First" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Every action is classified (safe / controlled / dangerous), gated, and
    audit-logged. Dangerous actions require human approval via GitHub issues.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Intent Pipeline" icon="list-format">
    Structured unit of work that flows through classification and governance
    before execution. Nothing happens without an Intent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Event-Driven" icon="star">
    Telemetry + PubSub powers real-time observability. LiveView subscribes and
    renders projections. No polling, ever.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Prerequisites

- **Erlang/OTP 27+**
- **Elixir 1.18+**
- **Node.js** (for Phoenix asset pipeline)

## Quickstart

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/plattegruber/lattice.git
cd lattice

# Install dependencies and set up the project
mix setup

# Start the development server
mix phx.server
```

Visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to see the Lattice dashboard.

For an interactive shell:

```bash
iex -S mix phx.server
```

## Environment Variables

Lattice uses environment variables to configure external integrations. None are required for local development with stubs:

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `SPRITES_API_BASE` | Sprites API base URL | For live sprites |
| `SPRITES_API_TOKEN` | Sprites API auth token | For live sprites |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | GitHub repo (e.g., `owner/repo`) | For GitHub HITL (or connect via UI) |
| `FLY_APP` | Fly.io application name | For Fly capability |
| `FLY_ORG` | Fly.io organization | For Fly capability |
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE` | Phoenix secret key | Production only |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Clerk Backend API key | For login |
| `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Clerk frontend JS key | For login |
| `LATTICE_INSTANCE_NAME` | Instance identifier | Optional |

When credentials are not present, Lattice automatically falls back to stub implementations for each capability.

In production, operators sign in via Clerk (GitHub OAuth) at `/login`. Their GitHub OAuth token is used for all GitHub API interactions, so a separate `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not needed. Repos can be connected through the UI at `/settings/repository`, which also auto-creates webhooks.

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Sprites](/lattice/concepts/sprites/) -- the process model for AI agents
- Understand [Intents](/lattice/concepts/intents/) -- the unit of work in Lattice
- Explore the [Dashboard](/lattice/guides/dashboard/) -- the operator interface
- Review the [Architecture](/lattice/architecture/) -- how the system fits together
