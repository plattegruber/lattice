description: "Lattice is a control plane for managing AI coding agents (Sprites). Real-time fleet operations with safety guardrails."
---

Lattice is an **Elixir/Phoenix control plane for AI coding agents**. It manages secure sandboxes called Sprites with real-time monitoring, governed workflows, and safety controls.

<Info>
**Sprites emit signals. Lattice makes decisions.**

Sprites are the execution layer -- they run skills and produce artifacts. Lattice is the control plane -- it classifies actions, enforces safety gates, and requires human approval for dangerous operations.

## What Lattice Does

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fleet Management" icon="server">
    Real-time LiveView dashboard for monitoring and managing your entire fleet of Sprites. See what every agent is doing at a glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Governed Workflows" icon="shield-check">
    Every action flows through the Intent pipeline: propose, classify, gate, execute, audit. Nothing happens without an Intent.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Safety Pipeline" icon="lock">
    Actions are classified as safe, controlled, or dangerous. Dangerous actions require human approval via GitHub issues.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time Observability" icon="chart-line">
    Telemetry + PubSub powers the event-driven dashboard. LiveView subscribes and renders projections. No polling, ever.

## How It Works

```
GitHub / API / Cron
        ↓
   Intent proposed
        ↓
   Classify (safe / controlled / dangerous)
        ↓
   Gate (allow / deny / await approval)
        ↓
   Execute on Sprite
        ↓
   Skills → Artifacts + Events
```
