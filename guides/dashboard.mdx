---

Lattice provides a real-time operations dashboard built with Phoenix LiveView. The dashboard subscribes to PubSub events and renders live projections -- it never polls. When a Sprite changes state, you see it immediately.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Start the server and visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser:

```bash
mix phx.server
```

The production dashboard is available at [https://lattice-broken-forest-2932.fly.dev](https://lattice-broken-forest-2932.fly.dev).

## Views

### Fleet View (`/sprites`)

The fleet view is the primary operations pane -- the "NOC glass." It provides:

- **Fleet summary** -- total sprite count and breakdown by observed state
- **Sprite list** -- each sprite with its ID, status, and last update time
- **Real-time updates** -- state changes appear instantly via PubSub
- **System capabilities** -- collapsible panel showing all active and planned features

The fleet view subscribes to the `"sprites:fleet"` topic and re-renders whenever the Fleet Manager broadcasts a summary update.

### Sprite Detail (`/sprites/:id`)

Click on any sprite in the fleet view to see its detail page:

- **Current state** -- desired vs. observed, with health indicator
- **Reconciliation history** -- recent reconciliation results and durations
- **State transitions** -- timeline of observed state changes
- **Health status** -- current health assessment with failure count
- **Exec sessions** -- active command execution sessions

### Intents View (`/intents`)

The intents view shows all intents in the system:

- **Active intents** -- proposed, classified, awaiting approval, approved, running
- **Completed intents** -- finished, failed, rejected, canceled
- **Filtering** -- by state, kind, source type
- **Real-time updates** -- intent lifecycle transitions appear live

### Intent Detail (`/intents/:id`)

Detailed view of a single intent:

- **Intent metadata** -- kind, source, summary, classification
- **Transition log** -- full history of state changes with actors and reasons
- **Payload** -- the intent's data including affected resources and expected side effects
- **Actions** -- approve, reject, or cancel (for intents awaiting approval)
- **Cross-entity navigation** -- click sprite names to navigate to sprite detail

### Approvals Queue (`/approvals`)

A focused view of intents that need human attention:

- **Pending approvals** -- intents in `:awaiting_approval` state
- **Classification context** -- why the intent requires approval
- **Approve / Reject** -- one-click actions with optional reason

### Incidents View (`/incidents`)

The incidents view shows safety audit entries:

- **Audit trail** -- every capability invocation with classification, result, and actor
- **Filtering** -- by capability, classification level, result status
- **Real-time stream** -- new audit entries appear as they are logged

### Audit Log (`/audit`)

Searchable audit log with:

- **Full history** -- all audit entries across all capabilities
- **Search** -- find entries by keyword across intents and sprites

## Navigation

The authenticated LiveView routes are:

| Path | View | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `/sprites` | Fleet | Fleet overview and sprite management |
| `/sprites/:id` | Sprite Detail | Individual sprite state and history |
| `/intents` | Intents | All intents with lifecycle tracking |
| `/intents/:id` | Intent Detail | Single intent with full transition log |
| `/approvals` | Approvals | Pending human approvals |
| `/incidents` | Incidents | Safety audit trail |
| `/audit` | Audit Log | Searchable audit history |

## Real-Time Updates

The dashboard uses Phoenix PubSub to receive real-time updates. Each view subscribes to relevant topics:

| View | Topic | Events |
|------|-------|--------|
| Fleet | `"sprites:fleet"` | Fleet summary changes |
| Fleet | `"sprites:<id>"` | Individual sprite state changes |
| Intents | `"intents:all"` | All intent lifecycle transitions |
| Intent Detail | `"intents:<id>"` | Specific intent transitions |
| Incidents | `"safety:audit"` | New audit entries |
